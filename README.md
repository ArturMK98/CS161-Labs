# CS161 Labs
This repository contains some of my Java lab exercises from [CS161](http://apps.maynoothuniversity.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&MODE=VIEW&MODULE_CODE=CS161#ANCHOR_SEARCH) in first semester of my first year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes the help of the demonstrators in the lab sessions. I also used online websites to help me understand some of the topics better and help me with the exercises, mainly [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).
