# CS161 Labs
This repository contains some of my Java lab exercises from [CS161](http://apps.maynoothuniversity.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&MODE=VIEW&MODULE_CODE=CS161#ANCHOR_SEARCH) in first semester of my first year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes the help of the demonstrators in the lab sessions. I also used online websites to help me understand some of the topics better and help me with the exercises, mainly [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Below is a list of all the labs and exercises in this repository along with a short description of each exercise:

# Lab 1
- [Printing1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Printing.java): A Java program which prints the message "Welcome to VPL" exactly to the screen.

- [Printing2](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Printing2.java): A Java program which prints the message "Hello" on one line and "world!" on the next.

- [Printing3](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Printing3.java): A Java program that prints out System.out.println("3 + 4"), System.out.println(3 + 4) and System.out.println(3 + "4") to demonstrate the diifference between each print statement.

- [PrintingVariables](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/PrintingVariables.java): A Java program that Declares an integer, called num1, and sets its value to be 5. Declares a double, called num2, and sets its value to be 2.3. Declares a character variable, called letter, and sets its value to be 's' and Prints each initialised variable on a new line.

- [UsingMod](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/UsingMod.java): A Java program that uses an int num that stores a 3 digit number, breaks up the number using the mod operator into its component digits and prints them out.

# Lab 2
- [Question1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Question1.java): A java program that demonstrates simple Addition, Multiplication & Division.

- [Selection](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Selection.java): A Java program that checks to see if the age of a person is greater than or equal to 18. If it is, a message saying that the person can vote is printed out; otherwise, a message saying they can't vote is printed out.

- [Selection2](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Selection2.java):  A Java program that uses if selection statements to print out the cost of a toll based on the type of vehicle.

- [Switch](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Switch.java): A Java program that uses a switch statement to print out the month of the year given a value between 1 and 12.

- [Ternary](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Ternary.java): A Java program that prints out the fee to use a golf course depending on whether the user is a member or not using the ternary operator.

- [Modulus](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Modulus.java): A Java program that declares 5 integer variables and determines how many of the numbers are odd or and how many are even.

# Lab 3

- [Factorial](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/Factorial.java): A Java program that uses a while-loop to find the factorial of a number.

- [While](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/While.java): A Java program that uses a while-loop to check how many times an integer num1 can be divided by 2 before the number becomes less than 2.

- [Song](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/Song.java): A Java program that uses a while loop to print out a song.

- [Loop](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/Loop.java): A Java program that uses a for-loop to print all numbers, followed by a space, that can be evenly divided by 7 between 10 and 70 inclusive.

- [ForLoop](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/ForLoop.java): A Java program that uses a for-loop to compute the sum of all numbers divisible by 13 between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and the sum of all numbers squared between 1 and 100 (inclusive).

- [Mod](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/Mod.java): A Java program that determines and prints the digits that make up every three-digit number that is divisible by 47.

- [DoWhile](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%203/DoWhile.java): A Java program that uses a do-while loop to determine if a positive integer number is a prime number.
