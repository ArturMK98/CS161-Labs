# CS161 Labs
This repository contains some of my Java lab exercises from [CS161](http://apps.maynoothuniversity.ie/courses/?TARGET=MODULE&MODE=VIEW&MODULE_CODE=CS161#ANCHOR_SEARCH) in first semester of my first year in college. All the exercises were completed by me and sometimes the help of the demonstrators in the lab sessions. I also used online websites to help me understand some of the topics better and help me with the exercises, mainly [stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/).

Below is a list of all the labs and exercises in this repository along with a short description of each exercise:

# Lab 1
- [Printing1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Printing.java): A Java program which prints the message "Welcome to VPL" exactly to the screen.

- [Printing2](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Printing2.java): A Java program which prints the message "Hello" on one line and "world!" on the next.

- [Printing3](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/Printing3.java): A Java program that prints out System.out.println("3 + 4"), System.out.println(3 + 4) and System.out.println(3 + "4") to demonstrate the diifference between each print statement.

- [PrintingVariables](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/PrintingVariables.java): A Java program that Declares an integer, called num1, and sets its value to be 5. Declares a double, called num2, and sets its value to be 2.3. Declares a character variable, called letter, and sets its value to be 's' and Prints each initialised variable on a new line.

- [UsingMod](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%201/UsingMod.java): A Java program that uses an int num that stores a 3 digit number, breaks up the number using the mod operator into its component digits and prints them out.

# Lab 2
- [Question1](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Question1.java): A java program that demonstrates simple Addition, Multiplication & Division.

- [Question](https://github.com/ArturMK98/CS161-Labs/blob/master/Lab%202/Selection.java): A Java program that checks to see if the age of a person is greater than or equal to 18. If it is,
